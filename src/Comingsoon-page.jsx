            Dear Friends,<br /><br />
            I'm really looking forward to spending next weekend with all of you in the countryside! I plan to take a bus and arrive at the station near the coffee shop at around 10 a.m. I'm eager to explore the area, maybe visit a museum, try some local cuisine, have a picnic, or even watch a movie together. Please let me know if you have any other plans in mind!<br /><br />

            I’m really looking forward to spending next Sunday in the capital! I plan to explore some of the iconic sights and maybe try out a few local dishes. It would be great to visit a museum or just take a stroll around the city. Let me know if you’d like to join or if you have any recommendations on what I should check out!<br /><br />

            4. Birthday party card
          </span>
          <span>
            Dear Matthew,<br /><br />
            I hope you’re doing well! I’m throwing a birthday party next Friday, and I’d love for you to come! It should be a fun evening with some of our friends—Sarah, Jake, and Emma will be there too. The party will be at my house, and you can easily get here by taking the bus to the main square and then walking for about ten minutes. If you need a ride, just let me know!<br /><br />
            Looking forward to celebrating together!<br />
            Cheers,<br />

          <span>
            My dream house would be in the countryside. It would be small but beautiful, with three rooms and a lovely garden. In the living room, I would prefer to have a comfortable sofa and a large television. The bedroom would have a warm bed and a small lamp. In the kitchen, there would be a table with some chairs and a big fridge. I would also grow colorful flowers and some trees in my garden. I hope to have a swing or a bench to sit on and enjoy the fresh countryside air. On weekends, I could have a picnic with my family or friends and create beautiful memories. I want to live there because it is quiet, comfortable, and helps me feel calm after a hard day.

            I started playing football when I was a child. At first, I didn’t know how to play well, but I practiced every day and now I can play better. I like being part of a team and working together with my friends to win. Sometimes we join small competitions at school, and it’s always exciting. I usually play as a striker because I love scoring goals. When I score, I feel very proud and happy. Besides Messi, I also like other famous players like Ronaldo and Mbappe. They inspire me to train harder. Football is not just a sport to me, it is also a way to relax and make new friends. I want to play football for a long time.

            Last summer, my family and I went on a wonderful trip to the beach. The weather was sunny and warm, perfect for outdoor fun. We swam in the sea, built sandcastles, and played ball games on the sand. The water was cool and very clear. We also ate delicious seafood at a small restaurant near the beach. I took many photos with my parents to remember the trip. In the evening, we walked along the shore, watched the beautiful sunset, and collected colorful seashells. I felt really happy and relaxed. It was one of the best times I’ve had with my family. I hope we can visit the beach again next summer and make more great memories together. The laughter and joy we shared during that trip will always hold a special place in my heart. Every moment spent together strengthened our bond and created lasting memories that I will cherish forever.

            My best friend’s name is Tom. He is kind, funny, and always ready to help others. Whenever I have a problem or need support, Tom is there to help me. We study in the same class, so we meet every day at school. After class, we often do homework together or play music, which is something we both enjoy. On weekends, we sometimes go to the park or ride our bikes around the neighborhood. Tom always knows how to make me laugh, and I feel happy when I’m with him. He listens carefully when I talk and truly cares about his friends. I’m really glad to have a best friend like Tom. He means a lot to me. Our shared experiences have brought us even closer, and I cherish every moment we spend together. Whether we're exploring new places or just hanging out at home, I always look forward to our time as friends.
